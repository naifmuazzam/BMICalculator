# BMICalculator
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented in C.
The program takes user inputs for name, IC number, height, and weight, calculates the BMI, and provides a status based on the calculated BMI.



# Usage

1. Compile the program using the following command: `gcc bmi.c -o bmi`
2. Run the compiled program: `./bmi`
3. Follow the prompts to input your name, IC number, height (in meters), and weight (in kilograms).
4. The program will display your entered information along with calculated BMI and status.

# Understanding BMI Status
- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25.0 and 29.9
- Obesity: BMI 30.0 or higher

For individuals falling in the "Underweight" category, the program also calculates the weight to gain to reach the ideal weight. 
For those in the "Overweight" or "Obesity" categories, it calculates the weight to lose to reach the ideal weight.
